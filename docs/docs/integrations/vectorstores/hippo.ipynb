Vaccinations and treatments have been effective in providing protection against the virus, and efforts are being made to authorize vaccines for children under 5. The government has provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks to control the spread of COVID-19. The article emphasizes the need to continue these efforts and not accept living with the virus as the new normal.\n",
      "==========================================\n",
      "response_without_hippo:COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus disease 2019, is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The virus quickly spread across the globe, leading to a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face. The symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe and include fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, organ failure, and even death.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent the spread of COVID-19, various measures have been implemented worldwide, including social distancing, wearing face masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and frequent sanitization of surfaces. Vaccines have also been developed and are being administered globally to control the spread of the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pandemic has had significant impacts on societies, economies, and healthcare systems worldwide. It has led to widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, school closures, and the adoption of remote work and online education. Efforts to control the virus and mitigate its impact continue to be a global priority.\n"
